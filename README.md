# Run n' Hunt

### Requires [Fabric](https://github.com/rizecookey/fabric/releases/tag/0.25.0%2B1.16.combat) and [Fantasy](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/fantasy/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

## The Idea:
We  have (?) runner(s) and (?) amount of hunter(s).

The goal of the runner is to last as long as possible without getting killed by the hunter.

Once the runner is killed, the hunter who killed the runner will become the runner. (like reverse tag!)
## Permissions

runnerhunter.manage | Gives you access to use **/runnerhunter**.
runnerhunter.manage.app | Gives you access to delete/create maps using **/map**.

## Ideas:
- Points system (the longer you survive as runner the more buffs you can get)
- Buffs could be items, and effects.
- GUIs
