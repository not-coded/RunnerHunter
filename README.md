# Run n' Hunt
**RunnerHunter** (also known ass **Runt** or **Run n' hunt**) is basically **reverse tag**.

### Requires [Fabric](https://github.com/rizecookey/fabric/releases/tag/0.25.0%2B1.16.combat), [Fantasy](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/fantasy/releases/tag/v0.4.0) and [Java 11](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11&package=jre)

## The Idea:
We have a runner and (?) amount of hunter(s).

The runner is **it**, their goal is to **survive as long as possible** without getting killed by the hunters.

If one of the hunters kills **it**, then they become **it**.

To win this game, you have to keep switching to being **it** for as long as possible, say for example **5 minutes** (game time: 15m).

If another person was **it** for the longest then they win.

## Permissions

**runnerhunter.manage** | Gives you access to use **/runnerhunter**.

**runnerhunter.manage.map** | Gives you access to delete/create maps using **/map**.

## Todo:
- Points system (the longer you survive as runner the more buffs you can get)
- Buffs could be items, and effects.
- GUIs
